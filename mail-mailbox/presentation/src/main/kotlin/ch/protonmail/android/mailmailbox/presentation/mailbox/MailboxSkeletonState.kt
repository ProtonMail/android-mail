/**
 * Decides when the mailbox loading skeleton is shown.
 *
 * The mailbox reloads for two very different reasons and only one of them warrants a skeleton:
 * - **Navigation** — a different account, label or category. The list on screen no longer belongs
 *   where the user is, so a skeleton is the honest thing to render.
 * - **In-place reload** — an unread / spam-trash filter toggle or a pull-to-refresh on the list the user
 *   is already looking at. Replacing it with a skeleton reads as a flash; the thin top loading bar
 *   already signals the activity.
 *
 * Paging cannot tell the two apart on its own, so [MailboxLocation] identifies the list and
 * [SettledViewLatch] decides which reload is which. [CategorySkeletonLatch] and
 * [rememberSkeletonVisibility] then keep the skeleton on screen as one steady frame for the whole
 * navigation instead of letting Paging's start-up oscillation blink through it.
 *
 * See ET-6553, ET-6594 and ET-6565.

/**
 * Identifies the list currently on screen. Any change means the user navigated somewhere else, so the

 * scroller starts loading its first page until the Paging refresh presents the new list. Without it,
 * the previous category's items flash back in between. See ET-6553.
 *
 * It arms by edge-detecting [ch.protonmail.android.mailmailbox.presentation.mailbox.model.MailboxListState.Data.firstPageLoadingStartCount]
 * rather than reading a toggling boolean: the state arrives through a conflated StateFlow, so a fast
 * start/end pair could be conflated away and never observed, leaving the skeleton un-armed (the
 * "loading too quick → stale flash" bug). A monotonic counter's latest value always reveals that a load
 * started, so the arm is reliable. It then stays latched — bridging the gap before the Paging refresh
 * begins — and clears once that refresh has been seen loading and has settled (the new list is present).

/**
 * Suppresses the loading skeleton for in-place reloads, so it only ever shows while navigating to a
 * different list. See ET-6594.
 *
 * A view counts as *settled* for a location once the pager has actually reloaded there — observed as
 * `reloading → not reloading` — and produced a non-loading view. That confirmation matters: the location
 * changes (a category tab flips, an account switches) one or more frames **before** the pager reacts, so
 * in between `rawView` is still rendering the *previous* location's items. Treating that as settled is
 * what would suppress the skeleton for the very navigation it is meant to cover, re-opening ET-6553.
 *
 * Only [MailboxScreenState.Empty] is ever held across a reload.
 * It renders no list content, so holding it is safe; every other state either wraps the live
 * [androidx.paging.compose.LazyPagingItems] — which would draw an empty list once the reload cleared it —
 * or is an error the user needs to see.

 * through to the "No messages" empty state — an `empty → skeleton → empty` blink. See ET-6594.
 *
 * The show edge and the immediate release on real items are part of the returned expression rather than
 * stored state, so both land in the same frame the inputs change; only the grace window that bridges the
 * oscillation needs to outlive a composition. Holding it in state written from composition instead would
 * invalidate the caller and cost a full extra recomposition of the mailbox on every flip.
 *
 * The window bridges the sub-frame gaps between refresh bursts, not a slow network: a genuinely ongoing
 * load keeps [rawVisible] latched for as long as it runs.
